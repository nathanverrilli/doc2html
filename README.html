     <h1>A Program to Transform<br />
       Complex Text Documents<br />to<br />
       Simple HTML</h1>
<p>Word processors are wonderful: they manage multiple versions,
  and WYSIWYG editors such as Microsoft Word, Wordperfect, and
  LibreOffice can double as document publishing tools for simple
  (and even complex) documents.
</p>
<p>
  But this power comes with a price. Retrieving nicely
  formatted text as simplistic HTML (without the powerful
  formatting capabilities) is hard. Native output to HTML
  wants to include font information, color information,
  metadata, complex paragraph rules, &hellip
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, all one wants is the simplest formatting.
  Headers, bold, italic, bold-italic, and paragraphs.
  Monospace, maybe. Retrieving that bare-bones HTML
  is <b>hard</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <tt>DOC2HTML</tt> makes it easy. It uses a powerful
  parser <i>(Apache Tika)</i>
  to identify and parse input. It then renders the document
  into simple HTML.
</p>
<p><tt>DOC2HTML</tt> was written for Java 11. There is an all-in-one
JAR file, so running it as simple as </p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Making sure the right Java is present on the system. From a
  command prompt, run:<br/></p>
  <div class="indent">
    <tt>java --version</tt>
  </div>
    <p>As long as the version is 11 or higher, all is well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download the <tt>doc2html.jar</tt> from the Release folder.
    This JAR is specially compiled as an all-in-one jar, thanks to
      the immensely useful
      <a href="http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/">One-JAR&trade;</a>
      project by Simon Tuffs. <i>Thank you, Simon, for this contribution to the open
    source community!</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>java -jar doc2html.jar -f MyDocument.docx -o MyOutput.html</tt>
  </li>
  <li>
    This project builds the base doc2html.jar file, but it does not build
    the more complex all-in-one jar. At some point, I will automate that
    process in the project, but that is very much a <tt>TO-DO</tt>.
